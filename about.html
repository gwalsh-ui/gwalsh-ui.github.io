    <p class="center">
        I am currently completing a M.Sc in Interactive Digital Media
        at the TCD School of Computer Science and Statistics. I
        graduated with a High 2.1 grade in my Bachelor (Hons) degree
        of Architectural Science from University College Dublin. I am
        highly proficient with software such as Photoshop, InDesign,
        Lightroom, Vectorworks, AutoCAD, Revit and Sketchup.</p>
    <p>
        During my degree, I was awarded a Scholarship to participate
        in the international programme “Port City, City Limits”, a
        collaboration between UCD and NCAD, resulting in a temporary
        exhibition at Ireland’s prestigious Hugh Lane Gallery. In 2017,
        I was one of five students to be highly commended by the Architectural
        Association of Ireland in its national student competition. In this
        competition, I was asked to design a spatial response to facilitate
        dissent, difference and a shared conversation of “what democracy looks
        like” responding to the current turbulent political times while
        addressing the disconnect between the abstraction of college projects
        and wider reality beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
        I bring with me a strong design ethos and genuine passion and enthusiasm
        for technology and design. I thrive under pressure and I am ambitious in
        my career goals and objectives. I am a dedicated worker, extremely detail
        oriented and have strong problem-solving skills. I have excellent
        interpersonal and communication skills and function well as a team member.
        I am willing, and able, to work long hours to accomplish whatever it takes
        to meet a deadline.
