<h2 class="couriernew">Interactive Digital Media Dissertation</h2>
<p>     The research project investigates the effect increased use of digital platforms during covid-19
    is having on virtual well-being, and how design interventions can be used to increase well-being
    digitally. As we have recently seen the rapid adoption of increased digital communication
    across all sectors of our economy and social engagements, this research is interested in the
    mental health impact on its users. This project will carry out a literature review examining
    the design principles and testing which has been adopted when creating recent projects, delving
    into any clinical studies as well gaining valuable insights from experts in the field of
    psychology and computer science on this effect on mental well-being. The research is interested
    in examining incidences of emotional changes, such as impact digital communication has in
    either exacerbating or decreasing loneliness, depression, or anxiety.

<h2 class="couriernew">Research Proposal</h2>
<p>
        I proposed a research project Mending Perceptions at the University of Cambridge which investigated
    the future architecture of psychiatric healthcare with a model which addresses stigma, therapeutic
    design, and a broader involvement in recovery. Through these conversations, my research interests
    shifted to the broader scale and how treatment might become more easily accessible and viable
    digitally. As such, my research interests are focused on researching existing digital well-being
    services and platforms.
